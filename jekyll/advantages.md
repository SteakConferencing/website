The Advantages
===
Providing a spatial representation for telephone conferences is promising.
Here, a _virtual_ sound environment can be created in which all speakers are positioned.
In addition to providing a more natural representation, a listener can exploit the added spatial information to identify and differentiate individual speakers.
A listener can also direct his auditory attention on individual speakers that he is actively listening to.
This is denoted as [cocktail party effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_party_effect).

With regard to telephone conferencing, the advantages of spatial representation have been investigated to some degree mainly with regard to [perceived quality (Quality of Experience)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_experience).
Here, the advantages of spatial representation have mainly been investigated for _high-end_ audio reproduction (fullband sampling, no compression, and high-end microphones and high-end pair of headphones) in laboratory experiments and rarely using production-ready or even production-capable systems.
Using such high-end systems, it could be shown that test participants preferred the spatial reproduction and it reduces the cognitive load (e.&thinsp;g., Skowronek, 2015).
Initial work has also been conducted on perception of telephony-related degradations in terms of packet-loss (Spur et al., 2015).

Nevertheless, the potential advantages which a spatial representation might provide depend heavily on the technical implementation in terms of robustness against telephony-related degradations (recording, transmission, and reproduction) as well as practical considerations in terms of usability.
