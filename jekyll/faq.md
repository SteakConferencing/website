The Demo
---

### Is their going to be a live demo available?

Yes.

We are working on it and we should be ready end of July.


The Website
---

### Why does the project website looks weird in my webbrowser?

Most likely your webbrowser does not support [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) with [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#CSS_3) and [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics).

The videos are coded in [H.264](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC).

### Who came up with the style of the website?
The style of the webpage is based upon a template called [hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde).

We just changed some things.
