On the 25th February 2017, the last commit from the STEAK project was merged into Asterisk upstream (__master__) and should be included in the upcoming release of Asterisk 15.

That's it - the STEAK project is now finished.

Just one thing is still (and will probably remain) missing: by default Asterisk does not provide an audio codec that supports multi-channel audio transmission.
For the STEAK project, we extended the open-source Asterisk driver for OPUS.

This driver can be found [here](https://github.com/SteakConferencing/asterisk-opus/).

To enable 3D-Audio for Asterisk using our OPUS driver:

```
git clone http://gerrit.asterisk.org/asterisk
git clone  https://github.com/SteakConferencing/asterisk-opus

cp asterisk-opus/codec/* asterisk/codec

./configure

make menuconfig
#Enable "Bridging modules"/binaural_rendering_in_bridge_softmix
#Enable "Codec Translators"/codec_opus_open_source
#Disable "Channel Drivers"/chan_sip

make
```
Tested with Asterisk (comit-id 00d1c7ddd28557aa845c3522956852a60310df96).
