The STEAK Project
===

In the STEAK project, we are implementing a [telephone conferencing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_call).
In difference to widely available system, this system will be providing [3D audio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_audio_effect) when headphones are used.
